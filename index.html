                    <p>
                       At the age of sixteen, Edith Eger was sent to Auschwitz. Hours after her parents were killed, Nazi officer Dr. Josef Mengele, forced Edie to dance for his amusement and her survival. Edie was pulled from a pile of corpses when the American troops liberated the camps in 1945.
                       Edie spent decades struggling with flashbacks and survivor’s guilt, determined to stay silent and hide from the past. Thirty-five years after the war ended, she returned to Auschwitz and was finally able to fully heal and forgive the one person she’d been unable to forgive—herself.
                       The Choice is a life-changing book that will provide hope and comfort to generations of readers.

                       In Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself, Joe Dispenza explains that unhappiness is the result of bad habits that make up our personality. Personal growth requires unlearning those habits, creating a new you, and using meditation to manifest the life you want.

                    <p>
                     In ancient times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged the One Ring,
					 filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken from him,
					 and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell into the hands
					 of Bilbo Baggins. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins finds himself
					 faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care.
					 Frodo must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom,
					 there to destroy the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.
